# Marketing agency webpage refactor

## Description

- What was your motivation?

The motivation behind the project was to make the webpage more accessibility friendly for users who require the use of a screen reader as well as to recognize redundancy of styling elements over multiple classes and how to consolidate them down.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

The project was completed as a means to educate us on how to look at an webpages existing code and how to replace code to be more accessibility friendly as well as to make the code more efficient.

- What problem does it solve?

It solves the problem screen readers have reading non-semantic code. By changing existing code, with more friendly/semantic code, users with disabilities can more easily access the information on the page with the use of semantic code, proper order of elements, alt tags for image description, and a concise page title.

With the removal of redundant code, we can make it easier to read and to manage.

- What did you learn?

I have learned the process of refactoring a webpage to make it more user friendly for users with disabilities that require screen readers.

I also learned how to examine code to see where there can be improvements made to reduce the amount of redundancy among the classes and css.
